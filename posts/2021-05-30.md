Its true, you can use vim inside your terminal, and what's more, its super easy to enable!
	
#### For ZSH users

Simply add the following to your `~/.zshrc` file:

```
bindkey -v
```

Then run `source ~/.zshrc` or restart your terminal to see it take effect!

#### For Bash users

Simply add the following to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```
bindkey -v
```

Then run `source ~/.bashrc` or restart your terminal to see it take effect!

#### Now that vim mode is enabled

You should now be able to hit `esc` once and enter `normal` mode. Pressing `i` will return you to `insert` mode (normal terminal usage)

While in `normal` mode, you can use vim bindings to move around your command, here are a few examples:

- Pressing `0` will return you to the start of the line
- Pressing `$` will send you to the end of the line
- Pressing `i` will put you back into `insert` mode 
- Pressing `s` will put you back into `insert` mode but remove the character you were on
- Pressing `a` will put you back into `insert` mode but after the character you were on

Now you can navigate your terminal like a certified pro, just like this guy:
