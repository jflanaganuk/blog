## From completely nothing to 3d text in your browser!

###### Monday 31/05/2021 - Joshua Flanagan

This blog post will take you from absolutely no code or dependencies to the following image in your browser:

(Strap in, this is gonna be fun üòé!)

#### Prerequisites 

You will need to be comfortable using a terminal and be using any of the following:

- MAC OSX
- Linux
- Windows with WSL 2 [information on how to install this here](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/how-to-install-wsl2-on-windows-10)

You will need a text editor of some kind, some examples with links are given here:

- VSCode (this is what I will be using) [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Notepad++ [download](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
- Sublime Text [download](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

You will need `node` and `npm` installed on your machine

- You can download node from [here](https://nodejs.org), it comes with npm as well!
- Alternatively (and arguably the better way) you could install `nvm` first and use that to choose the node version you want to use, we shall be using `14`
    - Nvm can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    - After installing and setting up, run `nvm install 14` and then `nvm use 14`

You can run `node -v` and `npm -v` to check if your installation have worked!

#### Setting up create react app

The first thing we are going to do is set up `react` (more info [here](https://reactjs.org/)), but instead of doing it all manually, we are going for speed and so will be using an `npm` package called `create-react-app` to set up most of it for us.

Navigate in your terminal to where on your machine you want to install your project and run:

```
npx create-react-app threejstext
cd threejstext
npm run start
```

Your browser may have opened automatically, but if not open your browser of choice and navigate to `https://localhost:3000` and you should see an image like the below:

#### Next steps

Now, you will want to open your project in vscode (leave the terminal window running that you currently have open, this will allow it to hot reload your changes)

You can do this one of two ways:

- Open VSCode normally and click "open folder" then navigate to your new project
- Navigate to your project in a terminal window and type `code .`

Open the terminal in vscode, we are now going to install some new dependancies

```
npm i react-three-fiber three
```

After this finishes, open up `src/app.js` in vscode

Currently it will contain something that looks like this:

```
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Remove most of the initial boilerplate code so you are left with:

```
function App() {
  return (
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### Creating your first threejs component

At the top of your file, add the following imports:

```
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber';
import fira from './Fira.json';
```

You will need to download the json file for the font we shall use [here](https://www.uploadr.co.uk/Fira.json)

Right click the above link and choose "Save Link As" and place the `.json` file inside your `src` folder.

Next, inside your `return` inside your `function App(){` add the following `jsx`:

```
<Canvas>
    <mesh>
        <textGeometry attach='geometry' args={[
        'hello world',
        {
            font: new THREE.FontLoader().parse(fira),
            size: 5,
            height: 1,
        }
        ]}/>
        <meshNormalMaterial/>
    </mesh>
</Canvas>
```

This does multiple things, it adds a canvas for threejs to render the text, as well as the geometry and the texture (meshPhongMaterial) of the text

If you look at your browser you should see _something_. It's not the text we expected, but that's because the camera is pointing to the wrong place and the css has not been set up to make the canvas fullscreen yet.

#### Fixing the canvas

Edit your `<Canvas>` component to the following, to override the default `height` and `width`

```
<Canvas style={{
    width: '100vw',
    height: '100vh'
}}>
```

You should see the canvas grow in your browser window.

Now to move the text into the correct position:

Change your `<mesh>` component to have the following attribute:

```
<mesh position={[-25, -1, -20]}>
```

These are `x y z` coordinates, and will move the text 25 `units` to the left, 20 `units` backwards and 1 `unit` downwards.

Finally, add a `<pointlight>` above your `<mesh>`

Your `App.js` file should look like this:

```
import { Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber';
import * as THREE from 'three';
import fira from './Fira.json'

function App() {
  return (
      <Canvas style={{
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh'
      }}>
        <pointLight/>
        <mesh position={[-25, -1, -20]}>
          <textGeometry attach='geometry' args={[
            'hello world',
            {
              font: new THREE.FontLoader().parse(fira),
              size: 5,
              height: 1,
            }
          ]}/>
          <meshNormalMaterial/>
        </mesh>
      </Canvas>
  );
}

export default App;
```
And you should see this amazing image in your browser!

#### Going further

This is awesome, and it's easily customisable by changing the "hello world" text to whatever you like!

But we can do more!

Lets add some camera controls so we can navigate around our creation!

First, we need to install another dependancy on the terminal

```
npm i @react-three/drei
```

(You may need to restart your `npm run start` command from earlier)

This is a collection of helper functions for react three fiber.

Add the following to your imports at the top of your file (`App.js`):

```
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';
```

Then add `<OrbitControls/>` just above your `<pointLight/>`

And for good measure, let's set the `backgroundColor` to be `'black'` for the `<Canvas>`.

Your `App.js` should look like this

```
import { Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber';
import * as THREE from 'three';
import fira from './Fira.json'
import { OrbitControls } from '@react-three/drei';

function App() {
  return (
      <Canvas style={{
        width: '100vw',
        height: '100vh',
        backgroundColor: 'black'
      }}>
        <OrbitControls/>
        <pointLight/>
        <mesh position={[-25, -1, -20]}>
          <textGeometry attach='geometry' args={[
            'hello world',
            {
              font: new THREE.FontLoader().parse(fira),
              size: 5,
              height: 1,
            }
          ]}/>
          <meshNormalMaterial/>
        </mesh>
      </Canvas>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You should now be able to move your camera around with your mouse!

- Left click and drag to rotate around your axis
- Right click pans you up, down, left and right
- Mouse wheel zooms you in and out

Your background should also have gone nice and black!

#### Lets go a bit crazy!

Now lets add lots of particles around the text to really give it an awesome effect!

Add the following above the `<OrbitControls/>` component:

```
{new Array(1000).fill(0).map(index => {
    return <mesh position={[(Math.random() - 0.5) * 100, (Math.random() - 0.5) * 100, (Math.random() - 0.5) * 100]}>
        <sphereGeometry attach="geometry" args={[0.2, 0.2, 0.2]}/>
        <meshPhongMaterial/>
    </mesh>
})}
```

This will create 1000 spheres at random points around the text object!

This should produce an image to match our final product! üëèüéâ Nice one! üòÑ
